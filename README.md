# v2-content
这个GitHub仓库存放了learn CF in a Week的所有章节的中文翻译。这些内容采用了Markdown语言编写。可以从这个网站了解更多关于Markdown语言的信息：https://www.markdownguide.org/ 。
If you see any sort of corrections that you would like to update, you can do one of two things. One, GitHub gives you the ability to edit the file in the browser, and commit the change as a pull request for review by the content editors. Two, if you would like to do a git checkout of the content to your local machine, you can also do this. This will allow you to make any changes you see locally, and then commit them back into GitHub for review by the content editors. One tool to use to edit the markdown would be Visual Studio Code because it has a built-in markdown previewer.
如果您要进行任何类型的更正，可以执行两项更改之一。

1. GitHub 使您能够在浏览器中编辑文件，并提交更改作为请求，供内容编辑器审阅。

2. 如果您要对本地计算机的内容进行 git 签出，也可以这样做。这将允许您在本地进行任何更改，然后将它们提交回 GitHub，供内容编辑器审阅。

# V1 Hands-on
The V1 hands-on files are being provided as a courtesy while the hands-on sections are rewritten.
The hands-on source is based on the previous version of the content so there are more than likely inconstancies.
